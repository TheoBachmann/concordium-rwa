//! This module contains the implementation of the RWA Identity Registry.
//! The `RwaIdentityRegistry` struct provides methods to interact with the RWA
//! Identity Registry contract. It interacts with the `IRwaIdentityRegistryDb`
//! trait to fetch data from the database. The API endpoints are defined using
//! the `poem_openapi` and `poem` crates, and the responses are serialized as
//! JSON using the `Json` type.
